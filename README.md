<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# Description


ShopStop is an E-commerce website built using React and Redux.

The user can browse though various categories of products, and add the items they want to buy to their cart, which is stored persistently in the local storage. The user can also register themselves and sign in to their account, or they can choose to sign in instantly using their Google account.

Finally, the user can buy the products in their cart using their credit card. A secure payment gateway has been integrated into the site.
